ppf-reconstruction
===================

This work aims at reconstructing 3D objects by robustly and accurately registering multiple range images of an object from different viewpoints.

An initial alignment between any two overlapping scans is obtained via a voting scheme which matches similar point pair features and thus constrains the relative 6DoF rigid body motion between the poses of two viewpoints. This initial alignment is then refined using pairwise point-to-plane ICP.

The result of this step is a tree of relative pose constraints. In a subsequent global optimization step, we build up a graph of absolute poses, our vertices, from the tree of initial relative pose estimates by adding further edges. We add edges for the k-nearest-neighbors of a vertex, taking the translational difference of the corresponding poses as a distance measure. Constraints between two vertices are added for each closest point correspondence in their respective point clouds. The global point-toplane energy is then minimized iteratively using the nonlinear least-squares method called Multiview Levenberg-Marquardt ICP.

This refined registration of all the scans used may now be integrated and their corresponding point clouds fused and then meshed to obtain the final reconstructed 3D object mesh.

### Dependencies

CMake, Eigen3, OpenCV, FreeGLUT, g2o

##### install on Mac OSX Yosemite using homebrew

Install [brew](http://brew.sh/) and then all dependencies:
```sh
brew install cmake eigen homebrew/science/opencv Caskroom/cask/xquartz homebrew/x11/freeglut
```

```sh
brew install https://github.com/adrelino/homebrew-science/raw/master/g2o.rb  
```
or
```sh
brew install homebrew/science/g2o
```
once pull request gets trough


We needed the xquartz app for freeglut to run. For that we might need to accept a license if never done before:
```sh
sudo xcodebuild -license   //accept license
```


##### install on Linux Ubuntu 14.04

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake libeigen3-dev opencv freeglut 
```
###### Build and install g2o

* if you have ROS indigo installed (http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu), there is a package for g2o:
```sh
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-libg2o
```

* otherwise manually download and build and install g2o:
```sh
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o.git
cd g2o
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Build and run ppf-reconstruction

Now we are ready to build our code
```sh
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/adrelino/ppf-reconstruction.git
cd ppf-reconstruction
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4 -l4
```

##### Run with sample bunny sequences
Real dataset aquired with a PrimeSense sensor:
```sh
./ppf-reconstruction
```

Synthetic dataset rendered using Blender:
```sh
./ppf_reconstruction -dir ../samples/Bunny_Sphere/ -knn 5 -nFrames 5
```
